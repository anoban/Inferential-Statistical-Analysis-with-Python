## ___Advantages of crossover design___
--------------------

__A crossover design is a repeated measurements design such that each subject receives the two different treatments (dark chocolate versus white chocolate) during the different two-week time periods, i.e., the patients cross over from one treatment to another during the course of the experiment. The order of which treatment was received in the first time period was randomized. Prior to receiving the first treatment, each participant underwent baseline measurements on the outcome variables.__

- An individual's body's response to any food uptake is highly variable, depedning on the individual's physiology, age, gender, weight, lifestyle etc. Allocating a fixed set of participants to each treatments will give leeway to their such differences influence the results asymmetrically. Which can lead to less accurate, erroneous conclusions. If such is the case, our experimental design allows too much frredom, to conclusively attribute the changes observed in the travelled distance to the chocolate intake.

- Crossover design mitigates this problem, because technically every participant in the larger participants sample will take part in each one of the treatment. Which makes the constributions of each participant's unique characteristics in contriving the results equally likely in both treatment setups. When a person with
