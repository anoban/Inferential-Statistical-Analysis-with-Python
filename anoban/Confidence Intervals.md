# ___Confidence Intervals___
----------------

The idea of confidence intervals is to express a statistic in the form of &rarr;

### ___= Best guess of the statistic $\pm$ Margin of error___

Margin of error comprises of 2 main parts:       
- A multiplier that reflects how confident we want to be.
- A parameter that reflects the sampling variability in our statistic.

## ___Notations___
--------

- ## ___Population mean &rarr; $\mu$___
- ## ___Sample mean &rarr; $\bar{x}$___
- ## ___Population standard deviation &rarr; $\sigma$___
- ## ___Sample standard deviation &rarr; $S$___

--------------

Very often 95% confidence intervals are used. When we discussed the __Empirical Rule__ a range of $\bar{x} - 1.96S~~to~~\bar{x} + 1.96S$ covered about 95% of the values in the normal distribution.

The multiplier of 1.96 that produces 95% coverage exactly. Some use 2 as the multiplier, which offers a little more coverage.

In random samples of a population, statistics will vary from sample to sample. So a distribution is available for our statistic itself, covering all the possible values of the statistic. Spread in that distribution reflects the variability of that statistic.

## ___Notations___
--------

Repeating the sampling process will yield a range of values for a given statistic.       
What do we call the true variability in the statistic? (The variability among all possible samples from the population of the given statistic)    

#### ___Note: Here the population is made of all the possible values for a given statistic &rarr; obtained through calculating the given statistic for all possible samples___

However, in reality, an exhaustive sampling is not feasible. We'd typically take a small number of samples and make an estimate about the statistic.     
In this case the statistic that we are interested in is standard deviation.

- ### ___The term used for the real standard deviation of test statistic &rarr; $Standard~deviation~of~the~statistic$.___
  
- ### ___The term used for the estimated standard deviation of test statistic &rarr; $Standard~error~of~the~statistic$.___
