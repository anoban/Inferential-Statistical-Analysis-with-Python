# ___Assumptions of Consistency___
------------------
------------------

### 1. _Population proportion_
-----------------
    - Samples can be considered simple random samples.
    - Large enough sample sizes.
    - At least 10 entities available in the sample, from each category, for hypothesis testing and confidence interval calculations.
   
### 2. _Difference between two population proportions_
-------------------
    - Samples can be considered two simple random samples.
    - Samples are independent of one another.
    - Large enough samples.
    - At least 10 entities available in the sample, from each category, for hypothesis testing and confidence interval calculations.
      
### 3. _Population mean_
-----------------
    - Samples can be considered simple random samples.
    - Sample comes from a normally distributed population. (this assumption allows us to leverage the central limit theorem CLT)
      
### 4. _Difference between two population means_
---------------
    - Samples are considered simple random samples.
    - Samples are independent of one another.
    - Samples come from normally distributed populations. (allows us to use the CLT)
    - Populations have equal variances. (if so, we can use the pooled approach, otherwise unpooled approach should be used.)
