# ___A Brief Introduction to Bayesian Statistics___
------------------

## ___There are two types of frameworks___          
- ___Frequentist statistics___
- ___Bayesian statistics___
 

This specialization focuses primarily on frequentist statistics.
Most concepts/ideas in frequentist statistics have extensions/adaptations for Bayesian statistics. 

The idea in frequentist statistics is an answer is either correct or incorrect.
i.e. there are only binary options.

E.g. What country won the 2022 FIFA?     
The answer is Argentina.     

An answer to this question is either 100% correct or 100% wrong.
There are no intermediate options like 50% correct.

Options like that are only possible under the Bayesian framework.
This is so because, in frequentist statistics, probabilities are made of real world. So, an event is either true or false. There's no inbetween.

In bayesian statistics, probabilities are made imaginatively (in minds)     


## ___Example___
--------------

Let's say that we have 4 chocolates. (3 silver and 1 purple)      
And we'll place them into 2 different bags (2 in each)
Bag A - silver, silver
Bag B - silver, purple

We now know that one bag has 2 silver chocolates and the next has a silver and a purple chocolates. Let's shuffle the bags to make them indistinguishable.   

And we'll pick one bag randomly. And pick one chocolate out of that bag.      
And the chosen chocolate turns out to be a silver chocolate.

- There is a 100% chance of getting a silver chocolate had the bag been A
- There's a 50% chance of getting a silver chocolate had the bag been B

In bayesian stats, we use this information to update the probabilities.
There are 2 ways we could've picked a silver chocolate from bag A
There's only one way we could've picked a silver chocolate from bag B

Since there were 3 silver chocolates in total, there's a 2/3 chance that this bag is A
And there's 1/3 chance that this bag is B

In frequentist statistics, either of the bags are 50% likely since we only have 2 bags.
